# Amidst Seed Hunter

Automates the hunt for seeds containing (or excluding) biomes using Amidst.

## Installation

No installation; it's a standalone executable. If you want to compile from source, you'll need to install AutoIt v3.

## Usage

If Amidst isn't open, it will prompt you for the executable and launch it for you.

In any case, you will need to set up Amidst to work properly. Amidst Seed Hunter works by searching for the unique biome color codes in the Amidst window. For best results, please do the following prior to running Amidst Seed Hunter:
* Turn on the grid and zoom to set the search area. If you want the biomes to appear within 2048 blocks, for instance, be sure that a square (centered on 0,0) is visible in the Amidst window. You will want to adjust the size of the window so that the seed information window is just slightly above the search area, and the icon in the lower right is just below it. Take a look at debug_image.jpg for help visualizing this.
* Once you've set the zoom, turn off the grid.
* Turn off all other layers.
* You're set! You can run Amidst Seed Hunter!

Choose the biomes you'd like to include in your search, as well as any you want to make sure don't appear (if desired).

Click "Begin Search" and get something to drink, because it's going to be a while.

The program will end when it finds a seed or hits the maximum number of seeds to search.
